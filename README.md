# AUCSC220_Project6
The primary objective of this project is to create an educational Memory Card Game for the Android platform using Android Studio as our IDE and Java as our programming language. The main aim of this game is to help enhance memory skills and cognitive development, primarily among children. The in-depth objectives of this project are:
# 1.1.1 Educational Enhancement
Improving memory: The gameâ€™s core aim is to help users, specifically children, enhance their cognitive proficiency. The interactive gameplay encourages users to remember the positions of similar-looking cards and make successful matches.
# 1.1.2 Accessibility and User-Friendly nature
Noncomplex User Interface: The app has an easy-to-use user-friendly interface designed to be easily traversable, even by younger players. It aims to provide a smooth user experience, allowing players to enjoy the game and improve their memory at the same time.

Inclusivity: The game's designed to provide different difficulty levels makes it inclusive, allowing players of all ages and skill levels to enjoy and not feel that the game is too easy or too difficult. It should be child-friendly and be equally engaging for adults seeking cognitive challenges.

# 1.1.3 Engagement 
Entertainment Value: While in the first place, it is an educational tool, the app also is created for entertainment purposes. The gameplay should be enjoyable, encouraging users to return for more sessions and practice. The graphics and animations are designed to be visually bright and memorable, so the user will come back to this game.
# 1.1.4 Learning Through Play
Interactive Learning: The app uses a "learning through play" approach. By memory improvement, it provides a more engaging and effective learning experience. Users are motivated to develop their memory skills naturally while having fun.
# 1.1.5 Customization and Adaptability
Customizable Experience: Users can choose from different difficulty levels and decide whether to play with or without a timer. These features prove that the app will be suitable for a wide audience, from beginners to experienced players.
